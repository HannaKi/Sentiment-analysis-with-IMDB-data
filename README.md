# Sentiment analysis with IMDB data

The purpose of this notebook is to experiment with hyperparameter search using Grid Search and sklearn Pipeline. I will build a simple pipeline for Support Vector Machine and a small fully connected neural network. 

The data I use is Stanford University IMDB data, available here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
